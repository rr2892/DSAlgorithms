# DSAlgorithms

Data structure and algorithm implementations that I completed over the course of the Practical Data Structures & Algorithms in Java course by Imtiaz Ahmad on Udemy. These are my implementations (different from his solutions). Each DS package contains a test class (App) and relevant classes for the data structure. Each algorithm package has a single class (Algo) containing testing and the implementation.
